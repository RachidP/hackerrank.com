# Go Profiling and Optimization

This code is example code used in my talk, Go Profiling and Optimization. See the
[video recording](https://youtu.be/N3PWzBeLX2M), and the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n6bse0JifemG7yve0Bb0ZAC-IWhTQjCNAclblnn2ANY/edit#slide=id.g3a3e2af65_029).

It shows how pprof and [go-torch](https://github.com/uber/go-torch) can be
used to identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize them.
