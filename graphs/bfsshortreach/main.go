Given a graph G D .V; E/ and a distinguished source vertex s, breadth-ﬁrst
search systematically explores the edges of G to “discover” every vertex that is
reachable from s. It computes the distance (smallest number of edges) from s
to each reachable vertex. It also produces a “breadth-ﬁrst tree” with root s that
contains all reachable vertices. For any vertex v reachable from s, the simple path
in the breadth-ﬁrst tree from s to v corresponds to a “shortest path” from s to v
in G, that is, a path containing the smallest number of edges. The algorithm works
on both directed and undirected graphs.*/
